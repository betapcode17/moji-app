In this project, I built a complete JWT-based user authentication system from scratch using React, Express, Zustand, and Axios Interceptors.
The goal is to create a secure and modern authentication flow for fullstack applications — including user registration, login, token refresh, and protected routes.
On the frontend, I used React for the UI, Zustand for global state management, and Axios interceptors to automatically attach and refresh tokens.
On the backend, I implemented an Express.js API with JWT authentication, password hashing using bcrypt, and secure cookie handling for refresh tokens.
This project demonstrates how to connect the frontend and backend seamlessly, ensuring both security and smooth user experience in a real-world fullstack environment.
